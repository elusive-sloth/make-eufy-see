Hello and welcome to my project.

This is one of my first attempts at a publicy hosted git repo.

GOALS: this project is aiming to add smarts to an old 11s eufy with some electronic components I have laying around the house. Whatever I use I will definitely add to the repos part list and a large part of the leg work has been done by user nakulbernde in his repo here:https://github.com/nakulbende/Make-Eufy-Smart-Again 

I was originally going to try and program the chips on eufy but without any good starting point for that I decided that having control over the functionality of the remote is probably a better place to start when attempting to smarten up the old but still useful vacuume.


phase 1 of this project will be getting the original example functioning on my non functioning eufy. the success criteria in my mind are as follows.
1. the esp 8266 is able to control the non operational unit the same as the remote.
2.I am able to prevent normal eufy error codes from stopping the unit
3. I am able to successfully incorporate a new sensor (lets say a sonar sensor since i have one on hand) into the system and create logic to incorporate the sensor.

phase 2 system from phase 1 is then incorporated into the working eufy and is able to perform as it did in phase 1.(this is possible to change depending on how phase 1 goes)

phase 3 utilize some of the main stream open source machine vision algorithms and apply them to the sonar and a usb camera to see about creating a smarter version of the eufy algorithm. (this is possible to change based on how phase 2 goes)

phase 4 incorporate all hardware into the eufy system and have it powered off of the eufy systems internal pcb(this will definitely be tried on the non functioning board first to prevent smoking my currently working eufy haha).

phase 5 the pretty up phase! :cad out some nice looking parts to make the hardware look less like a abomination and more like a wart of sorts attached to the eufy :) ).
